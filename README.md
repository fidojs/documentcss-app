# documentCSS.app

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).

## Quick Start

```console
$ git clone
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ npm dist
```

## Notes

Any computer this app is installed to must have Node and npm configured on path.
